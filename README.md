# PEEPS-Software
Repository containing the MATLAB code required for the pressure measuring Arduino board.

## Theory of Operation
* This MATLAB LiveScript will process serial data packets every 100 ms, or at a sampling frequency of 10Hz.
* The packets contain data sampled straight from a 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) and are therefore in a range of 0-1023.
* This range corresponds to an analog voltage range of 0-3.3VDC, such that 512 would indicate a reading of 1.65 volts.
* **To Do:** A transfer function translates the raw ADC values into pressure, based on the datasheets of the two sensors:
  * [MPXV7002](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MPXV7002.pdf)
  * [BLCR-L10D](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Amphenol%20All%20Sensors%20Corp/BLCR%20DS-0354_Rev_E.PDF)

## Interface
This code reads the comma-separated data packets from a serial port, configured at 115200 bps.
